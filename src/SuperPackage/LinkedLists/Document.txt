head = The initial pointer which will point to null if there is no Node present. Or if it is referring to nothing.
tail = The last node which points to null is the node which will be called as tail.
Node -> stores the data and the pointer to the next node.
Node.next -> Points to the next node in the linked list if there is! Else points to null

    - We need an extra Node reference so that when we traverse the linked List
        we don't disrupt the structure of the node.
    - We can insert an element to the last position of the node is O(1) time by simply assigning the
        Newly created node which will be attached at the head to the tail by a simple if condition.
    - We can traverse the entire linked list based on head and tail and a temporary reference variable
        by using a while loop till temp reaches the end.
